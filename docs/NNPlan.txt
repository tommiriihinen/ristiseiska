Does history matter?
	-> Yes, past turns give clues to your opponents cards
		-> Recurrent neural networks RNNs

Learning process
	-> Can play millions of games
		-> Unsupervised
			-> Genetic Algorithm or Reinforcement Learning?
				-> Reinforcement, cuz i believe in it

Incomplete knowledge of outcomes?
	-> Custom error function to ignore certain turns in backprop
		-> AI won't think it did neutrally when there is no knowledge

Will the model learn from random games?
	-> Very limited choices in every turn, it is concievable
	
Plan:
1. Plan for what data a RNN would need 
2. Build a random player
3. Build a benchmark from the old AI and the random player.
4. Gather data from old AI (benchmark it)
5. Build a RL NN
6. Train it on gathered data
7. Train it against itself (benchmark generated data and label it with benchmarks )
8. Build the RNN and train it on this data
9. Train RNN against itself.

TL;DR
1. Plan data
2. RandomPlayer
3. Benchmark component
4. Make Data
5. Make Neural Network
6. Train it on old data
7. Train it against itself
8. RNN->


RNN DATA REQUIREMENTS: EVERY GAME MOVE

Number of players:
 3  4	 5  6	 7 
[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]: 5
Cards in hand:
[]: 52
Cards on board:
[]: 52
Action:
[1]:1
Current Player
 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]: 7
His card on this turn:
[]: 52
How many cards current player has after turn
[]: 18

META:
Winner:
[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]: 7

Total (5 + 8 + 1 + 52 + 52 + 52 + 18) + 8
	= 188 + 7 = 195


RL NN: in: 111 out: 52

RL RNN: in: 178 out: 52
